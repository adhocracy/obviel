1.0b2 (unreleased)
==================

* Unfortunately ``<element>``, ``<attribute>`` and ``<block>`` did not
  work well in IE. Instead you can now use ``data-el``, ``data-attr``
  and ``data-unwrap`` on any DOM element.

1.0b (2012-05-31)
=================

* Added Obviel Template language implementation. This replaces
  JSON-Template as Obviel's preferred template language. Obviel Forms
  makes use of it internally. Obviel Template supports features such
  as sub-views and i18n. See the :doc:`Obviel Template documentation
  <template>` for more detail.

* :doc:`i18n documentation <i18n>`: how to do i18n with Obviel.

* Added Traject library. This library allows routing of paths to
  objects and the inverse: constructing paths for objects. See the
  :doc:`Traject documentation <traject>` for more detail.

* Added ``transformer`` hook. This allows Obviel to transform content
  it retrieves from the server using URLs and hyperlinks.

* Added ``object_events`` structure, allowing you to declare events on
  the object the view is rendering. Also introduce ``rerender`` method
  on view.

* Added ``before`` hook to views. You can now pass a ``before``
  function when configuring a view. This function will be called
  before rendering (including before template rendering). This is useful
  to manipulate ``this.obj`` to add extra information before the template
  is rendered.

* Obviel Forms now uses a special view for the iface
  ``obviel_forms_error_area`` to render error areas. You can define a
  view and render your own error area. In this view create an element
  with id ``this.obj.field_error_id`` to hold the field error message,
  and an element with id ``this.obj.global_error_id`` to hold the
  global error message.
  
* Obviel Forms now sends an event soon as an error message is set or
  cleared. The event names are ``field-error.obviel-forms``,
  ``field-error-clear.obviel-forms``, ``global-error.obviel-forms``,
  ``global-error-clear.obviel-forms``. The events are sent to the
  element on which the error message is rendered, and will bubble up
  (so you can catch them on a higher level). The ``target`` property
  of the event will also have a reference to the element on which the
  message was set.

0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
===================

* Last release changed the obviel forms translation domain from
  ``obviel_forms`` to ``obviel-forms``, but forgot to adjust the forms
  code to take this into account.

0.11 (2012-01-13)
=================

* Added js.obviel Fanstatic_ integration.

* Added Python-based obvielts test server for testing Obviel with a
  "live" test server.

* Included jslex_prepare script to help with i18n process. See updated
  ``doc/i18n.txt`` for notes.

* Updated translations to include support for obviel-forms-datepicker and
  obviel-forms-autocomplete.

0.10 (2011-11-04)
=================

* Obviel models may now have an ``iface`` or an ``ifaces`` property,
  but not both. ``ifaces`` may be a string instead of an array. This
  makes the common mistake to make a model object with ``iface`` not
  a mistake anymore.

* Update test dependencies to newer version of jQuery and jQuery-ui.
  These are also used by the demo code. Made it so that the version
  number of dependencies not in the URL anymore, so that it's easier
  to update in the future.

* Included datatables as a dependency, though haven't integrated
  code using it yet.

* Add Obviel patterns ``multi``, ``event`` and ``redirect`` to
  new ``obviel-patterns.js``. See the pattern demo page in the
  documentation for a demo of these.

* Integrate support for simple jGrowl messages in
  ``obviel-jgrowl.js``; see the pattern demo page for examples.

* Reorganized directory structure: everything, including tests and demos 
  are in 'src' now, which in turn is included in the documentation so we
  can link to demos (and its dependencies) from there.

0.9.1 (2011-11-03)
==================

* Include form demo in documentation.

0.9 (2011-11-02)
================

Initial public release.
