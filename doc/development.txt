Developing Obviel
=================

Here is some information on how we develop Obviel and how you could
participate.

Please talk to us our on our :ref:`mailing list <mailing list>` about
your plans!

Sources
-------

Obviel's source code is maintained on bitbucket:
http://bitbucket.org/obviel/obviel

You can check it out using `Mercurial`_ (hg); see the bitbucket_
documentation for more information as well.

.. _`Mercurial`: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

.. _`bitbucket`: http://bitbucket.org

Feel free to fork Obviel on bitbucket if you want to hack on it, and
send us a pull request when you want us to merge your improvements.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

Obviel's documentation is written using restructured text and Sphinx_.

To build the documentation of Obviel you need Python 2.6 or Python
2.7. First you need to install buildout, a tool that installs some
useful scripts for us. In the Obviel project directory, type the
following::

 $ python bootstrap.py -d
 $ bin/buildout

After you've done this once, you can build the documentation using
Sphinx::

  $ bin/sphinxbuilder

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

The docs source is in ``doc``, the built documentation will be
available in ``doc/_build/html``.
