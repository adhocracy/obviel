Obviel core
===========

.. function:: obviel.iface(name[, *bases])

  Declare an iface.

  :param string name: A unique string identifying the iface.  
  :param `*bases`: Optional extra iface strings that are interpreted
    as base ifaces that this iface extends.

  Register an iface with the name ``name``. Note that declaring
  an iface is not required in order to use it; you can just refer
  to any iface, declared or not, by name. 

  A registered iface always automatically extends a special iface
  ``base``.

.. function:: obviel.provides(obj, base)
 
  Check whether an object provides an iface.

  :param obj: Any JavaScript object.
  :param string base: A string identifying an iface.
  :returns: ``true`` if obj provides iface ``base`` (or an
    iface that extends ``base``.

.. function:: obviel.extendsIface(name, base)

  Register a new base iface for an iface.

  :param string name: Identifies the iface to extend.
  :param string base: Identifies the base iface that this iface extends.

.. function:: obviel.ifaces(obj)

  Obtain all ifaces that this object provides, going recursively
  through base interfaces, breadth first.

  If no ``ifaces`` attribute is available, the JS type of the object
  is returned instead.
  
  :param obj: Any JavaScript object
  :returns: a list of ifaces that the obj provides.

.. class:: obviel.View(settings)
 
  :param settings: an object of which the properties will become
     properties of the view itself.

  You can create a View by instantiating one and then registering it
  with :func:`obviel.view`, but that function also allows creation of a new
  view directly from a settings object.

  If you want to create your own view types that provide more features
  particular to specific use cases, you should derive your view from
  the ``View`` class.  One example of this is :class:`Widget` from the
  Obviel forms library.

.. function:: obviel.view(view)

  Register a view with Obviel. This allows Obviel to look up the view
  for the ``iface`` with which the view was registered.

  :param view: a view object to register with Obviel. As a
    convenience, you can also provide a bare JavaScript object, which
    will be converted to a :class:`View` object with the object's
    properties.

.. function:: obviel.transformer(transformer)

  :param transformer: a function with the ``function(obj, url, name)``
    signature, or ``function(obj, url)``, or ``function(obj)``.

  Register a transformer function with Obviel. Obviel will pass any
  object retrieved from the server using URL access (i.e. a hyperlink
  reference in an object) through this transformer function.

  The transformer function has three arguments:

  ``obj``

    The object retrieved from the server that can be transformed.

  ``url``

    The URL used to access the object on the server. Could be
    used to determine what transformation to apply. Optional.

  ``name``
 
    The name used to render the view. Optional.
  
  The transformer function must return the transformed object.

  By default Obviel does no transformation, and objects are passed
  from the server to Obviel unchanged.

  You can disable the transformer function by passing in ``null``.

.. function:: element.render(obj[, name, callback, errback])

  Render a view for an object on a jQuery element. This instantiates a
  view by cloning it from the registered view and then calls its
  :func:`obviel.View.render` method.
    
  :param obj: The JavaScript object to render. Alternatively this
     can be a string, which will then be interpreted as a URL. The
     URL will be fetched and the resulting JSON object will be
     the object to render.
  :param name: The name of the view to render for the object. If
     not supplied the name ``default`` will be used.
  :param callback: A callback function to call when the rendering
     has been completed. ``this`` will be the view instance
     that was used for the rendering.
  :param errback: currently not supported.

  All methods of the :class:`View` object will have access to the
  following properties on ``this`` during rendering:

  * ``el``: the jQuery element that the view is being rendered on.

  * ``obj``: the object being rendered.

  * ``callback``: the callback function, if supplied.
  
  * ``errback``: the errback function, if supplied.

  * ``registry``: the :class:`Registry` in which the view was
     looked up.

.. function:: element.rerender([callback, errback])

.. function:: element.view()

.. function:: element.parent_view()

.. function:: element.unview()

View options
++++++++++++

Views have a number of options you can pass into them in the
``settings`` parameter when registering a view using
:func:`obviel.view`. Views also define some convenience methods.

.. class:: obviel.view

  .. attribute:: iface

    The iface (a string) for which the view is registered. The view
    will only be looked up on objects that provide the given
    ``iface``.

    While it is optional and defaults to registering the view for all
    JavaScript objects, you would almost always want to supply an
    ``iface`` property to a view.

  .. attribute:: name

    The name of the view. It is optional, and defaults to
    ``default``. The name is used when a view is looked up, along with
    the iface, but for lookup also the default name is
    ``default``. The difference between name and iface during lookup
    that iface is provided from the object being rendered, while the
    name is provided by the calling code as an argument to
    :func:`element.render`.

  .. attribute:: render
 
    A function which will be added as a method to the view. In it, the
    developer can refer to ``this.obj`` to access the object the view
    is rendering, and ``this.el`` to access the jQuery DOM element on
    which the view is rendering. The ``el`` property is typically
    manipulated in the ``render`` method to make the view actually do
    something.

    Supplying a ``render`` method is optional.

  .. attribute:: before

    An optional function that will be called before any rendering
    (template or otherwise) takes place. This is most useful to to
    manipulate ``this.obj`` to set extra information in it that the
    template needs.

  .. attribute:: cleanup

    An optional cleanup function that will be called when the
    (non-ephemeral) view is being cleaned up from the element it was
    rendered on, either explicitly because :func:`element.unview` was
    called on it, or implicitly because something else is being
    rendered on the element.

  .. attribute:: ephemeral

    A boolean value. By default it is ``false``. If set to ``true``,
    the view will not be associated with the element. This is useful
    for views that are not really associated with the DOM, such as
    popup messages or views that redirect to other views.

  .. attribute:: html
 
    A string with a snippet of HTML that should be inserted into the
    DOM upon rendering. This will be done before any
    :func:`obviel.view.render` function is called.

    This property is optional, and by default there will be no HTML
    snippet insertion.

  .. attribute:: html_url
 
    A string with a URL to a resource with a HTML snippet in it. This
    HTML snippet will be loaded if the URL has not been previously
    seen, otherwise it is retrieved from a cache. The HTML snippet is
    inserted into the DOM as with :attr:`html`.

    This property is optional.

  .. attribute:: jsont

    A string with a JSON template. The template is rendered with the
    object being rendered as the context, and the resulting HTML
    snippet is inserted into the DOM as with :attr:`html`.
 
    This property is optional.

  .. attribute:: jsont_url

    A URL referencing a resource that is a JSON template. This
    template will be loaded if the URL has not been previously seen,
    otherwise it is retrieved from a cache. The HTML snippets that
    results from rendering the template will be inserted into the DOM
    as with :attr:`html`.

    This property is optional.

  .. attribute:: subviews

    A JavaScript object literal describing subviews of this view.
    Each property name define a jQuery selector that will be issued on
    the element being rendered by the outer view that is being
    rendered. The resulting elements will be have the sub view
    rendered on them. The property value identifies a property on the
    model object that is being rendered. This property is accessed: if
    it is a sub object, it will be rendered directly. If it is a
    string, this string is interpreted as a URL identifying the object
    to be rendered, as with :func:`element.render`.

    To render a named subview, use a property value that is an array
    instead: the first item is interpreted as the property name
    identifying the subobject or URL to be rendered, and the second
    item is the view name to use to look up the subview.

  .. attribute:: events

    A JavaScript object literal describing event handlers to hook up
    for this view. Each property name is the name of the event, such
    as ``click``. The property value is another object literal, where
    each key is a jQuery selector and the value either a function or a
    string that indicates the event handler. The jQuery selector
    determines to which elements in the view the event handlers are
    bound.

    If the event handler is a function, this function is the event
    handler. It will receive a single parameter that is the event. The
    event object has a ``view`` property that you can use to access
    the view that issued the event.

    If the event handler is a string, this is used to identify a
    method of the view that is the event handler. This method also
    receives a parameter ``ev`` that has a ``view`` property, but the
    view can in this case also be accessed as ``this``.

  .. attribute:: object_events

    A JavaScript object literal describing event handlers to hook up
    to the object rendered by this view. Each property name is the
    name of the event. These are generally custom event names you can
    come up with yourself. The property value is either a function or
    a string indicating the event handler.

    If the event handler is a function, this function is the event
    handler. It will receive a single parameter that is the event. The
    event object has a ``view`` property that you can use to access
    the view that issued the event.

    If the event handler is a string, this is used to identify a
    method of the view that is the event handler. This method also
    receives a parameter ``ev`` that has a ``view`` property, but the
    view can in this case also be accessed as ``this``.

  .. attribute:: domain
   
    The translation domain to use for any associated Obviel Template.
    If no ``domain`` is specified, the current translation domain
    specified by :func:`obviel.i18n.translate` is used.

  .. function:: rerender()

    A convenience method that is useful to refer to using declarative
    events or object events. This method when called will re-render
    the object on the element. This is useful for instance when the
    underlying object has changed.

Obviel Template
===============

Everything is in the ``obviel.template`` namespace.
  
.. class:: obviel.template.CompilationError

  Exception. Something went wrong during compilation of a template.

  .. attribute:: el

    The JavaScript DOM node, typically an element node, on which compilation
    failed.

  .. attribute:: message

    Message describing what went wrong during compilation.

.. class:: obviel.template.RenderError

  Exception. Something went wrong during compilation of a template.

  .. attribute:: el

    The JavaScript DOM node, typically an element node, on which rendering
    failed.

  .. attribute:: message

    Message describing what went wrong during rendering.

.. function:: obviel.template.register_formatter(name, func)

  Register a global formatter. Is done when the UI starts up (per
  page), before any templates are compiled. Note that with Obviel
  you can also use view methods as formatters.

  :param string name: the name of the formatter. This is how it is
    addressed in the template language (using ``{foo|formatter_name}``).
  :param function func: the formatting function. It gets the text (string)
    to format as its argument and should return the formatted text.

.. function:: obviel.template.get_formatter(name)

  Return a global formatter. If no formatter can be found,
  ``undefined`` is returned.

  :param string name: the name of the formatter to look up.
  :returns: the formatter function or ``undefined``.

.. function:: obviel.template.clear_formatters()

   Clear all previously registered formatters. Typically used during
   unit test teardown.

.. function:: obviel.template.register_func(name, func)

  Register a global element adjustment function. Is done when the UI
  starts up (per page), before any templates are compiled. Note that
  with Obviel you can use view methods as funcs

  :param string name: the name of the func. This is how it is
    addressed in the template language (using ``data-func="func_name"``).
  :param function func:  the function that manipulates the element. This 
    function takes 1 to 3 arguments: the jQuery element ``el`` to manipulate, 
    a ``variable`` resolver function (optional) and a ``context``
    object (optional). Should manipulate the element, for instance by
    using ``el.addClass``. The ``variable`` resolver function can
    be used by the function to look up variables; get the value of
    variables in the current scope by calling it with a variable
    name as a string (``variable(variable_name)``).

.. function:: obviel.template.get_func(name)

  Return a global element adjustment function. If no func can be found,
  ``undefined`` is returned.

  :param string name: the name of the func to look up.
  :returns: the func or ``undefined``.

.. function:: obviel.template.clear_funcs()

   Clear all previously registered funcs. Typically used during
   unit test teardown.

.. class:: obviel.template.Template

  A template. To instantiate and compile, create a new ``Template``
  object with a ``text`` argument. The ``text`` argument should be a
  HTML fragment that will be compiled, or alternatively a jQuery
  selector indicating an element to be compiled (everything in it will
  be compiled).

  Can throw :class:`CompilationError` if the text could not be compiled.

  .. function:: render(el, obj, context)

    Render template on jQuery element ``el``, using ``obj`` to resolve
    variables, and using ``context`` as the rendering context.

    :param object el: jQuery element to render the template on.
    :param object obj: Object to render. Variables in the templates
      will be resolved from ``obj``.
    :param object context: This is an object that may have these
      properties:

      ``get_translation``
        A function that takes a single string argument and returns the
        translation for that string. If no translation is available
        the string itself should be returned. If not supplied no
        translations are looked up. Used by ``data-trans``.

      ``get_handler``
        A function that gets a single name argument and returns the
        handler that matches that name. If no handler can be found by
        that name, ``null`` should be returned. Used by
        ``data-handler``.

      ``get_formatter``
        A function that gets a single name argument and returns the
        formatter function that matches that name. This function will
        get a single value argument and should return the formatted
        value.  If no formatter can be found by that name, ``null`` or
        ``undefined`` should be returned. Used by
        ``{variable|formatter}``. If no ``get_formatter`` is supplied,
        the template engine will use globally registered formatters
        (using ``obviel.template.register_formatter``). See also
        :func:`obviel.template.register_formatter`.

      ``get_func``
        A function that gets a single name argument and returns the
        element manipulation function that matches that name. This
        function will get three arguments: the element to manipulate,
        a variable lookup function and a context. If no func can be
        found by that name, ``null`` or ``undefined`` should be
        returned. Used by ``data-func`` to look up the func. If no
        ``get_func`` is supplied, the template engine will use
        globally registred funcs (using
        ``obviel.template.register_func``). See also
        :func:`obviel.template.register_func`.

.. function:: obviel.template.variables(translation, variables)

  A simple way to interpolate variables into a text, in particular for
  the purposes of i18n.

  Given a text with variables (marked with ``{`` and ``}``) and an
  object (hash) of variables, interpolate variables into text. This
  can be used from JavaScript to interpolate Obviel Template-like
  translation variables, instead of jsgettext's ``strargs``, which
  only works with positional values.

  :param string text: The text (with variables).
  :param object arguments: A key-value mapping where the key is the 
    variable name.
  :returns: The text with variables interpolated.

.. function:: obviel.template.tokenize(text)
  
  Tokenize text using Obviel Template rules. Name tokens are marked by
  ``{`` and ``}``, the rest are text tokens.

  :param string text: Text to tokenize.
  :returns: an array of token objects. Each token object has a 
    ``type`` property that indicates the token type (``NAME_TOKEN`` or
    ``TEXT_TOKEN``, and a ``value`` property. In case of
    ``NAME_TOKEN`` this is the name between ``{`` and ``}``, in case
    of ``TEXT_TOKEN`` this is the text.

Obviel Forms
============

A form structure is could be returned from the server-side but an also
be defined on the client. It should have the iface ``viewform``.

Form options
++++++++++++

.. class:: obviel.forms.viewform

  .. attribute:: widgets 

    An array of form widget objects.

  .. attribute:: controls

    An array of form control objects. Defaults to an empty array.

  .. attribute:: data

    The object representing the form contents. Defaults to the empty
    object and is maintained by the form.

  .. attribute:: disabled
 
    A boolean. If ``true``, the whole form is rendered in a disabled
    state and cannot be submitted.

  .. attribute:: validation_url

    A URL to do global validation on. Submitted to this URL will be
    the form's ``data`` object (as JSON). The server needs to decode
    this JSON object and do validation on it. The server returns a
    data structure (as JSON) with the same structure as what was
    submitted, with the values replaced by error messages (or left
    out). The minimum object a global validator needs to return is the
    empty (``{}``) object. This object will be placed in the
    ``global_errors`` attribute of the form.

  .. attribute:: errors

    The object representing the error messages currently visible in the
    form. If this object is not empty, form submission will not proceed.

    This defaults to the empty object and is maintained by the form.

  .. attribute:: global_errors

    The object representing server-generated error messages currently
    visible in the form. If this object is not empty, form submission
    will not proceed.
 
    This defaults to the empty object and is maintained by the form.

Widgets
+++++++

.. class:: obviel.forms.Widget

  .. attribute:: name
  
    The internal name of the widget. This will be the name of the property
    under which the inputted value will be stored in the ``data`` object.

    This must therefore be a valid avaScript property name.

  .. attribute:: title

    The label that will be shown for the widget in the user interface.

  .. attribute:: description
  
    A longer description of the widget that will be shown in the user
    interface. May be omitted.

  .. attribute:: validate
  
    A sub-object describing how this widget is to be validated. Validation
    properties differ per widget.

  .. attribute:: validate.defaultvalue

    The default value that should be shown in the widget if no
    specific value is available in the ``data`` object.

.. class:: obviel.forms.InputWidget

  iface: ``input_field``

  Base class for all widgets based on the ``<input type="text">`` field.

  Derives from :class:`Widget`.

  .. attribute:: width

    Width of the field in em. By default there is no explicit width
    and the system uses the browser-defined default width of the input
    field.

  .. attribute:: max_length

    The maximum length that may be entered into this widget by the
    user.  This is a physical limitation in the browser, not a
    validation limitation. By default there is no max length.

  .. attribute:: disabled

    Render the widget as disabled and allow no input. By default,
    disabled is ``false``.

  .. attribute:: validate.required

    This widget is required: a value must be entered by the user
    before the form can be submitted. By default, widgets are not
    required.

    Example::

      validate: {
        required: true
      }

.. class:: obviel.forms.TextLineWidget

  iface: ``textline_field``

  Lets the user enter a single line of text, in an ``<input
  type="text">`` widget. Becomes a string in the ``data`` object.

  Derives from :class:`InputWidget`.

  .. attribute:: validate.min_length

    The minimum input length in characters allowed.

  .. attribute:: validate.max_length
  
    The maximum input length in characters allowed.

  .. attribute:: validate.regs

    An array of zero or more objects. Each object must have a ``reg``
    property which is a JavaScript style regular expression, and a
    ``message`` property which is a string. If the input does not
    match ``reg``, ``message`` will be displayed as the error message.

    This allows you to write regular expression based custom
    validators for user input.

.. class:: obviel.forms.TextWidget

  iface: ``text_field``

  Lets the user enter a multiline text in a ``<textarea>``
  widget. Becomes a string in the ``data`` object. 

  Derives from :class:`TextLineWidget`.

  .. attribute:: height
   
    The height of the textarea in em.

.. class:: obviel.forms.IntegerWidget

  iface: ``integer_field``

  Lets the user enter an integer number. Floating point numbers are
  not accepted, only integers. Becomes a JavaScript number in the
  ``data`` object.

  Derives from :class:`InputWidget`.

  .. attribute:: validate.allow_negative

    If ``true``, negative numbers are allowed as input. Defaults to ``false``,
    not allowing negative numbers.

  .. attribute:: validate.length

   Only allow input to a fixed number of digits given by
   ``length``. If not set, any amount of digits will be allowed.

.. class:: obviel.forms.FloatWidget

   (``.``), but could be set to ``,`` or something else to suit other
   locales.

  .. attribute:: validate.allow_negative

    If ``true``, negative numbers are allowed as input. Defaults to ``false``,
    not allowing negative numbers.

.. class:: obviel.forms.DecimalWidget

  iface: ``decimal_field``

  Lets the user enter a decimal number. Becomes a string in the
  ``data`` object for parsing into a server decimal object.

  Derives from :class:`InputWidget`.

  .. attribute:: validate.separator

   Define the decimal separator. By default this is the period
   (``.``), but could be set to ``,`` or something else to suit other
   locales.

  .. attribute:: validate.allow_negative

    If ``true``, negative numbers are allowed as input. Defaults to ``false``,
    not allowing negative numbers.

  .. attribute:: validate.min_before_sep

    Maximum amount of digits that are allowed to be present before the
    separator. If omitted, there is no maximum.

  .. attribute:: validate.min_after_sep

    Minimum amount of digits that need to be present after the separator.
    If omitted, there is no minimum.

  .. attribute:: validate.max_after_sep

    Maximum amount of digits that are allowed to be present after the
    separator. If omitted, there is no maximum.

.. class:: obviel.forms.BooleanWidget

  iface: ``boolean_field``

  Lets the user enter a boolean, ``true`` or ``false`` in a checkbox,
  using ``<input type="checkbox">``.

  Becomes a JavaScript boolean in the ``data`` object.

  Derives from :class:`Widget`.

.. class:: obviel.forms.ChoiceWidget

  iface: ``choice_field``

  Lets the user select a choice from a drop-down box. This uses 
  ``<input type="select">``.

  Becomes a string in the ``data`` object.

  Derives from :class:`Widget`.

  .. attribute:: empty_option

    The value that will be shown and submitted if the field is not
    filled in. If not given, the first option in the drop down list will
    be the default if the field is ``required``.

  .. attribute:: width

    The width of the drop-down box in em.

  .. attribute:: choices

    An array of choices that the user can select. Each entry in the
    array is an object with a ``value`` and a ``label`` property.
    The ``value`` will be the value submitted, and the ``label`` will
    be how this value is represented in the user interface.

.. class:: obviel.forms.DisplayWidget
 
  iface: ``display_field``

  This is a display-only field that the user is not allowed to edit. The
  value will be shown in a ``<span>`` element. 

  The server code is responsible for really forbidding changes
  to fields represented by display widget.

  Derives from :class:`Widget`.
  
.. class:: obviel.forms.HiddenWidget

  iface: ``hiden_field``

  This is special form of the display field that will be hidden from 
  view, represented using ``<input type="hidden">``.

  Derives from :class:`DisplayWidget`

.. class:: obviel.forms.DatePickerWidget
 
  iface:: ``datepicker_field``

  This is data input widget which offers picking a date from a
  calendar. Is represented in ``data`` in the ``yy-mm-dd`` format,
  where ``yy`` is a four digit year, for example ``2011-10-01``.

  Since this widget depends on jquery-ui for its implementation, it is
  maintained in a separate field, ``obviel-forms-datepicker.js``,
  which should be included to be able to use this widget.

  Derives from :class:`TextLineWidget`

  .. attribute:: dateFormat

    The format that the date should be displayed as. Note that 
    the date will always be saved in ``yy-mm-dd`` format, where
    ``yy`` is a four-digit year, so for example ``2011-11-01``.

    This follows the rules from jquery-ui's datepicker:

    http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat

    http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate

    By default the date format is ``mm/dd/yy``.

  .. attribute:: showOn

    When to show the date picker.

    This follows the rules from jquery-ui's datepicker:

    http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-showOn

    By default the datepicker is shown when the button is clicked.

  .. attribute:: constrainInput

    This follows the rules from jquery-ui's datepicker:

    http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-constrainInput

    By default it is set to ``false``.

.. class:: obviel.forms.AutocompleteWidget
 
  iface:: ``autocomplete_field``

  This is a text line input with autocompletion, and can therefore be
  used like a :class:`ChoiceWidget`. Autocomplete widgets can either
  include all options directly in the form structure, or supply a
  server URL on which to look up values to autocomplete. The latter is
  more scalable if the amount of possible choices is very large.

  Since this widget depends on jquery-ui for its implementation, it is
  maintained in a separate field, ``obviel-forms-autocomplete.js``,
  which should be included to be able to use this widget.

  Derives from :class:`TextLineWidget`

  .. attribute:: data

    The autocomplete data. This may either be an array of objects 
    with properties ``label`` and ``value``, much like the possible
    values for a :class:`ChoiceWidget`, or it can a string, in which
    case it is interpreted as a URL.

    If interpreted as a URL, the URL will get either a single
    ``identifier`` parameter or a combination of a ``term`` and
    ``limit`` parameters. If a single ``identifier`` parameter,
    the server should interpret this as a ``value`` and should return
    the ``label`` that belongs to it. If a ``term`` and a ``limit``
    parameter, ``term`` is a search term that the server should use
    to look up matching ``label/value`` pairs, and return them as
    an array with objects each with a ``label`` and ``value`` property. The
    limit parameter is used to indicate to the server the maximum amount 
    of matches the server should return.

Custom widgets
++++++++++++++

Custom widgets will need to subclass :class:`InputWidget` and
provide some methods. This is the typical pattern::

  obviel.iface('custom_field', 'input_field')

  // constructor
  module.CustomWidget = function(settings) {
     settings = settings || {};
     var d = {
         iface: 'custom_field' // set up iface
     };
     $.extend(d, settings);
     module.InputWidget.call(this, d); // call superclass
  }; 

  // set up inheritance
  module.CustomWidget.prototype = new module.InputWidget(); 

  module.CustomWidget.prototype.validate = function(value) {
    // use inherited validate function first
    var error = module.InputWidget.prototype.validate.call(this, value);
    // if we have an error in inherited validation, we are done, return
    // that error
    if (error !== undefined) {
        return error;
    }
    // custom validation goes here, either do: return undefined (or
    // plain bare return) or return error message
    return undefined;
  }

  // convert function is necessary if we convert to non-String JavaScript
  // value. Can also be used for strings even if we don't convert 
  // away from it, for instance to check whether a date string is really
  // parseable at all, and to format it to a common format if so.
  // in addition convert and its pair convert_back can be used to update
  // the browser DOM in more complex ways than the default implementation
  // allows.
  module.CustomWidget.prototype.convert = function(value) {
    // convert the empty input to null, so that validation for
    // required can do its work
    if (value === '') {
        // return an object with a ``value`` property with the converted value.
        return {value: null};
    }
    // try to interpret the input as the value type we want
    var asint = parseInt(value, 10);
    // if the interpretation did not succeed, return an object
    // with an ``error`` property with the error message.
    if (isNan(asint)) {
        return {error: 'not a number'};
    }
    // return an object with a ``value`` property with the converted value.
    return {value: asint};
  }

  // convert a JavaScript representation back into the widget representation
  // (typically a string)
  module.CustomWidget.prototype.convert_back = function(value) {
    // super call
    value = module.InputWidget.prototype.convert_back.call(this, value);
    return value.toString();
  }

  // finally register the widget as a view with Obviel
  obviel.view(new module.CustomWidget());  

Traject
=======

Everything is in the ``traject`` namespace.

.. class:: traject.ParseError

  A parse error when parsing a path.

  .. attribute:: message

    The error message.

.. class:: traject.ResolutionError

  Error resolving a path to an object: object cannot be found.

  .. attribute:: message

    The error message.

.. class:: traject.LocationError

  Error constructing a location (or path) for an object.

  .. attribute:: message

    The error message.

.. class:: traject.RegistrationError

  Error during registration.

  .. attribute:: message

    The error message.

.. class:: traject.Patterns

  .. function:: register_converter(converter_name, converter_func)

  Register a variable converter.

  :param string converter_name: The name of the converter as it will
    appear in the variable declaration (``$foo:<converter_name>``).
  :param function converter_func: A function that takes the variable
    to convert and returns the converted variable.

  .. function:: register(pattern_str, lookup)

  Register a lookup function for a path pattern.

  :param string pattern_str: A path pattern. These are zero or more
    steps separated by ``/``, where each steps is either a string, or a 
    $variable (or $variable:converter).
  :param function lookup: A function that should return the object
    matching the path variables. It will receive a single variables
    object as an argument, and its properties are the concrete values
    used in the path in place of the variables. It can also return ``null``
    or ``undefined``, indicating thatd the object cannot be found.
  
  Can throw :class:`ParseError` if the path cannot be parsed.

  Can throw :class:`RegistrationError`` if the path cannot be
  registered due to unknown converters or conflicts in registration.

  .. function:: register_inverse(iface, pattern_str, inverse)
 
  Register an inverse function (from object to variables) for 
  objects of an iface and a pattern.

  :param string iface: The iface that this inverse is registered for.
    When an object is located, the iface of the object is used to
    look up the inverse function.
  :param string pattern_str: A path pattern as for :func:`register`.
    This is used to reconstruct the path for the objects.
  :param function inverse: A function that takes an object as an argument
    and returns a variables object for it that can be used to reconstruct
    its path, so should have a property for each of the variables in the path.

  .. function:: pattern(iface, pattern_str, lookup, inverse)

  Register both a path lookup as well as the inverse at the same time.

  :param string iface: The iface that this inverse is registered for.
    When an object is located, the iface of the object is used to
    look up the inverse function.
  :param string pattern_str: A path pattern as for :func:`register`.
    This is used to reconstruct the path for the objects.
  :param function lookup: A function that should return the object
    matching the path variables. It will receive a single variables
    object as an argument, and its properties are the concrete values
    used in the path in place of the variables.

    and returns a variables object for it that can be used to reconstruct
    its path, so should have a property for each of the variables in the path.

  Can throw :class:`RegistrationError` if the path cannot be
  registered due to unknown converters or conflicts in registration.

  .. function:: set_default_lookup(f)

  .. function:: resolve(root, path)

  Resolve a path to an object according to registered patterns,
  starting at ``root``.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param string path: A concrete path. It will be matched with the
    registered paths to find the lookup function.
  :returns: The object found.

  Can throw :class:`ResolutionError` in case the path cannot be
  resolved to an object.

  .. function:: resolve_stack(root, stack)

  Resolve a stack to an object according to registered patterns,
  starting at ``root``. A stack is a stack of steps in a path, in
  reverse order.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param array stack: A stack of steps, in reverse order from the path.
    It will be matched with the registered paths to find the lookup function.
  :returns: The object found.

  Can throw :class:`ResolutionError` in case the stack cannot be
  resolved to an object.
  
  .. function:: consume(root, path)

  Resolve a path as far as it can be resolved according to registered
  patterns, then stop resolving the path. Does not throw a
  :class:`ResolutionError`, instead simply stops.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param string path: A concrete path. It will be matched with the
    registered paths to find the lookup function.
  :returns: An object with three properties, ``unconsumed``, an array of
    steps that could not be resolved (in stack form, reverse order), 
    ``consumed``, those steps that have been successfully consumed when
    resolving the path, and ``obj``, the object found at the end of 
    path consumption (if no path could be consumed at all, this object
    will be ``root``).

  .. function:: consume_stack(root, stack)

  Resolve a stack of steps as far as it can be resolved according to
  registered patterns, then stop resolving the stack. Does not throw a
  :class:`ResolutionError`, instead simply stops.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param array stack: A stack of steps, in reverse order from the path.
    It will be matched with the registered paths to find the lookup function.
  :returns: An object with three properties, ``unconsumed``, an array of
    steps that could not be resolved (in stack form, reverse order), 
    ``consumed``, those steps that have been successfully consumed when
    resolving the path, and ``obj``, the object found at the end of 
    path consumption (if no stack could be consumed at all, this object
    will be ``root``).

  .. function:: locate(root, obj)

  Locate ``obj``, giving it ``traject_name`` and ``traject_parent``
  properties and placing it in a virtual hierarchy, such that
  following ``traject_parent`` will eventually result in the ``root``
  object.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param object obj: The object to locate.

  Can throw :class:`LocationError` in case the object can not be located.
  
  .. function:: path(root, obj)

  Locate ``obj``, and return its path. This also gives the obj
  ``traject_name`` and ``traject_parent`` properties and places it in
  a virtual hierarchy, such that following ``traject_parent`` will
  eventually result in the ``root`` object.

  :param object root: An object that is the root to the virtual hierarchy
    created by traject. When following ``traject_parent`` back you will
    end up at the ``root`` object.
  :param object obj: The object to get the path for.
  :returns: The path for ``obj`` according to the patterns.

  Can throw :class:`LocationError` in case the object can not be located.

Obviel i18n
===========

Everything is in the ``obviel.i18n`` namespace.
  
.. class:: obviel.i18n.I18nError

  Exception. Something went wrong during translation; in particular a locale
  or domain cannot be found.

  .. attribute:: message

    Message describing what went wrong.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.translation_source(data)

  Create a source of translations from mapping.

  :param object data: A mapping from the language used in the source code to
    the language being translated to. Alternatively can use a more complicated
    jsgettext array structure as values.
  :returns: The translation source.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.translation_source_from_json_url(url)

  Create a source of translations from a URL.

  :param string url: A URL to a JSON object that contains a jsgettext-based
    translation.
  :returns: The translation source.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.empty_translation_source()

  Create an empty source of translations. This means no translation
  will take place. This can be useful to register the translations for
  the locale that the UI is written in.

  :returns: The translation source.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.register_translation(locale, translation_source[, domain])

  Register a translation source for a locale and a domain.
  
  :param string locale: A locale identifier, such as ``en_US``.
  :param translation_source: A translation source.
  :param domain: The i18n domain for the translations. If domain is not 
    specified, the ``default`` domain is used.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.clear_translations()

  Clear the translations. Useful during test teardown.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.set_locale(locale)

  Changes the locale that the application is working in to a new
  one. This loads the locale information according to previously
  specified information, for instance using :func:`obviel.i18n.load`.

  :param string locale: A locale identifier, such as ``en_US``.
  :returns: A promise that is done when the locale has been loaded.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.clear_locale()

  Clears the locale that the application is working in to an empty one.
  Useful during test teardown.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.get_locale()

  Returns the current locale.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.get_translation(msgid, domain)

  Gives back the translation for a msgid in a particular domain, given
  the current locale.

  :param string msgid: The message id or text to translate.
  :param string domain: The translation domain.
  :returns: The translation for msgid in the domain.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.get_translation_func(domain)
 
  Gives back a function that takes the msgid and returns the
  translation in the domain.

  :param string domain: The translation domain.
  :returns: A function that can be given a msgid to return the translation
    in the specified domain.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.translate(domain)

  Set up translations for a module. Intended to be called at the top
  of your module, like this::

     var _ = obviel.i18n.translate('foo');

  This changes the template domain to ``foo``, and also returns a
  function that when called with a message id, will return the
  translation in the domain ``foo``. The convention is to assign this
  to ``_`` so that extraction tools can extract occurrences from .js
  source code.

  :param string domain: The translation domain.
  :returns: A function that can be given a msgid to return the translation
    in the specified domain and current locale.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.pluralize(domain)

  Set up plural translations for a module. Intended to be called at the
  top of your module, like this::

    var ngettext = obviel.i18n.translate('foo');

  The ``ngettext`` function can be called with three parameters:

  * singular text ("1 elephant")

  * plural text ("three elephants")

  * count
 
  Based on the value of count either the singular text or plural text
  will be used, and translated to the current locale and the specified
  domain (``foo``, in this case).

  :param string domain: The translation domain.
  :returns: A function that can be given a singular msgid, a plural msgid
    and a count and will return the right text for the locale, domain and count.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.get_template_domain()

  Gives back the default domain in use by Obviel templates.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.variables(translation, variables)

  An alias for :func:`obviel.template.variables`. Only available if
  Obviel Template is available when Obviel i18n is being loaded.

.. function:: obviel.i18n.load()

  Load i18n information as indicated by link elements in document. This
  should be called when the document is ready.

  The link tags should look like this::

    <link href="something.i18n" ref="i18n" type="application/json" />

  The ``.i18n`` file indicated is a JSON file that describes what
  translations are available for which domains. You can link in
  multiple ``.i18n`` files in one page. The ``.i18n`` file should look
  like this::

    {
       "<domain>": [
           { 
             "locale": "<locale>",
             "url": "<locale_url>"
           }
       ]
    }

  A domain may have information about more than one locale. The
  ``.i18n`` file may have entries for more than one domain. The
  ``url`` entry may be a relative URL, relative to the URL of the
  ``.i18n`` file itself. ``url`` may also be ``null``, in which case
  the locale will not have any translations available and thus will be
  in the source language.

  :returns: A promise that is done when the i18n information has been
    loaded.  Recommended is you do the
    :func:`obviel.i18n.set_locale()` in the done handler.
