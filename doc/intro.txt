Introduction

Introduction
------------

Obviel is a model/view abstraction for JavaScript that helps you
structure JavaScript applications. Obviel is built on jQuery and
integrates with it. Obviel is versatile and unobtrusive.

We believe Obviel will help with any website that uses JavaScript, but
it is especially geared towards RESTful rich client applications.

Obviel's particular strength is its support for *loose coupling*
between client and server: the JavaScript codebase on the client and
the server implementation (in any language) can be developed
relatively independently from each other. The JavaScript code needs to
know little about the URL structure presented by the server, and the
server code needs to know little about how its data is presented
through JavaScript.

Obviel also comes with a powerful JSON-based form framework, built
with Obviel.

Obviel features include:

Obviel core
-----------

* Decouple views from each other and from the server: URL-agnostic
  views, Javascript agnostic server.

* deep jQuery integration with the ``render`` function:
  ``$('#foo').render(obj)``

* Declarative composite views (subviews).

* Declarative setup of event handlers.

* Support for long and short-lived views.

Hyperlinking
------------

* Obviel works with RESTful data structures on the server: hyperlinked
  JSON.

* Supports bootstrapping single-page applications from a single URL;
  all the rest of the information can be retrieved through hyperlinks.

HTML generation
---------------

* Support for client or server-side HTML generation.

* Support for static HTML inclusion.

* JSON Template template language support.

* Pluggable system for client-side template languages, so that other
  client-side template languages can be plugged in.

Obviel Forms
------------

* Powerful form framework built on basic Obviel views and JSON.

* Forms load and save JSON directly, no HTML form decoding or
  generation on server, just work with JSON.

* Widgets for textline, text, integer, float, decimal, boolean
  (checkbox), choice (drop-down), display, date, autocomplete, and
  more.

* Client-side validation: instant error messages if the user ends the
  wrong data.

* Server-side validation support for complex validation requirements
  that involve multiple fields.

* Easily extensible with new widgets.
  
* Powerful composite and repeating fields to construct complex nested
  forms out of simple widgets: fields that represent sub-objects and
  arrays of objects.

* Integration with gettext i18n framework for custom translation of
  error messages.

Code
----

* extensive unit test coverage

* well-structured JavaScript code that eats its own dogfood: Obviel
  Forms built on Obviel core.

* Obviel core is less than 8 kB of minified JavaScript code, Obviel forms
  library is 22 kB. gzipped you can include them both in less than 10
  kB!
