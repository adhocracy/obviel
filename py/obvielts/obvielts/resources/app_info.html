<h2>Obviel Test Server</h2>
<p>
This is the Obviel Test Server. It is used to do manual tests for UI
components that need a live server to be fully testable. 
</p>
<p>
It can also serve as an additional demo for Obviel components. Finally
we hope that the server code can give you some idea of how you can use
Obviel in Python with <a href="http://fanstatic.org">Fanstatic</a>.
</p>
<p>In particular we are showing the datatables component:</p>
<table id="table">
</table>
