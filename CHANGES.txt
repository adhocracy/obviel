CHANGES
*******

0.11 (unreleased)
=================

* Added js.obviel Fanstatic_ integration.

* Added Python-based obvielts test server for testing Obviel with a
  "live" test server.

.. _Fanstatic: http://www.fanstatic.org

0.10 (2011-01-04)
=================

* Obviel models may now have an ``iface`` or an ``ifaces`` property,
  but not both. ``ifaces`` may be a string instead of an array. This
  makes the common mistake to make a model object with ``iface`` not
  a mistake anymore.

* Update test dependencies to newer version of jQuery and jQuery-ui.
  These are also used by the demo code. Made it so that the version
  number of dependencies not in the URL anymore, so that it's easier
  to update in the future.

* Included datatables as a dependency, though haven't integrated
  code using it yet.

* Add Obviel patterns ``multi``, ``event`` and ``redirect`` to
  new ``obviel-patterns.js``. See the pattern demo page in the
  documentation for a demo of these.

* Integrate support for simple jGrowl messages in
  ``obviel-jgrowl.js``; see the pattern demo page for examples.

* Reorganized directory structure: everything, including tests and demos 
  are in 'src' now, which in turn is included in the documentation so we
  can link to demos (and its dependencies) from there.

0.9.1 (2011-01-03)
==================

* Include form demo in documentation.

0.9 (2011-01-02)
================
