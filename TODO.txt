'validate' should have a sensible default
=========================================

It should be possible for 'validate' to be absent from the widget
structure and it should use a sensible default then.

should we make 'obviel' a namespace?
====================================

We have 'views' and 'formviews' as namespaces for our app now, but we our
package is called 'obviel', should we use that as namespace (either instead,
or in addition to, the existing ones)?

DONE, 'views' is not called 'obviel', and 'formviews' is 'obviel.forms'
