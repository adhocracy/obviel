Obviel: Object/View/Element for JavaScript
==========================================

Obviel is a model/view abstraction for JavaScript that helps you
improve the structure of JavaScript applications. It's built with
jQuery. It is especially geared towards RESTful rich client
applications, but should work for any website that uses
JavaScript. Obviel's particular strength is its support for *loose
coupling* between client and server: the JavaScript codebase on the
client is relatively independent from the server implementation.

Obviel is a framework to help structure rich-client web
applications. With Obviel, the client provides simple JSON data
structures and the client then provides Obviel views to render
them. Obviel also provides a powerful JSON-driven form library.

Obviel is built on jQuery. It is versatile and unobtrusive, and should
help in improving the design of many types of web applications.
