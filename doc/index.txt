Obviel: Object/View/Element for Javascript
==========================================

Obviel is a framework that helps structuring your rich-client web-applications.
It's designed for web-applications where the server provides simple JSON
data structures, and the client is entirely responsible for presenting those
structures, though it's relatively versatile and unobtrusive and may be of
assistence in improving the design of many types of applications where
JavaScript is used.
