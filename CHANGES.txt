0.10 (unreleased)
=================

* Obviel models may now have an ``iface`` or an ``ifaces`` property,
  but not both. ``ifaces`` may be a string instead of an array.

* Update test dependencies to newer version of jQuery and jQuery-ui.
  These are also used by the demo code. Made it so that the version
  number of dependencies not in the URL anymore, so that it's easier
  to update in the future.

* Add Obviel patterns ``multi``, ``event`` and ``redirect`` to
  new ``obviel-patterns.js``. See the demo page in the
  documentation for a demo of these.

* Reorganized directory structure: everything, including tests and demos 
  are in 'src' now, which in turn is included in the documenation so we
  can link to demos (and its dependencies) from there.

0.9.1 (2011-01-03)
==================

* Include form demo in documentation.

0.9 (2011-01-02)
