Obviel: Object/View/Element for Javascript
==========================================

Obviel is a framework to help structure rich-client web
applications. With Obviel, the client provides simple JSON data
structures and the client then provides Obviel views to render
them. Obviel also provides a powerful JSON-driven form library.

Obviel is built on jQuery. It is versatile and unobtrusive, and should
help in improving the design of many types of web applications.
