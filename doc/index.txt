Obviel: Object/View/Element for JavaScript
==========================================

Obviel is a model/view abstraction for JavaScript that helps you
improve the structure of your jQuery-based JavaScript applications.

What is Obviel all about?

JSON-centric
------------

Obviel builds on JSON. Without insanely nested callback functions
everywhere!

Versatile but unobtrustive
--------------------------

Obviel is powerful. Obviel is also small. If you already know jQuery,
you just have to learn about Obviel's ``render`` method and you will
be almost there already!

Supports true REST development patterns
---------------------------------------

We don't just say that REST is cool and go through the motions. An
Obviel-based app can start with a single URL and find out about the
rest of your application's URLs by following hyperlinks in JSON. And
that's RESTful.

Loose coupling between client code and server code
--------------------------------------------------

Because of REST, your server and client code become loosely
coupled. Imagine changing your server code and having your client UI
adjust itself without changing a line on the client? With a
well-designed Obviel app, this is often possible!

Client-side templating
----------------------

If you're going to build a rich client-side application, why not use a
client-side templating engine? Obviel has an integrated (but optional)
template language that features sub-view rendering and a powerful
gettext-based internationalization system.

Form library
------------

Besides Obviel core, we also include a powerful client-side form
library based on Obviel core. Describe your form using JSON
structures. Get your form data as JSON. Use composite and repeating
fields with ease!

Routing with Traject
--------------------

Obviel also contains an easy to use but powerful routing library
called Traject, which can be used to resolve paths to objects and the
inverse: construct paths for objects. With Traject you can make
dynamic single-page user interfaces that work with hyperlinks and the
browser back button.
