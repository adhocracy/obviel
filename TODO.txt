'validate' should have a sensible default
=========================================

It should be possible for 'validate' to be absent from the widget
structure and it should use a sensible default then.

should we make 'obviel' a namespace?
====================================

We have 'views' and 'formviews' as namespaces for our app now, but we our
package is called 'obviel', should we use that as namespace (either instead,
or in addition to, the existing ones)?

DONE, 'views' is not called 'obviel', and 'formviews' is 'obviel.forms'

Feature suggestion
===================

Ability to get the view object from a rendered view
----------------------------------------------------

It'll be nice if we can get the view object from a rendered view so that we
can register useful methods to it and call it from another view. eg:

    obviel.view({
        iface: 'myview',
        render: function (el, obj, name) {
            ....
        },
        search: function (key) {
            ... do stuff ...
        }
    });
    $(el).render({ifaces:['myview']});
    var viewobj = $(el).getView();
    viewobj.search('hello');

Catch: el and obj might need to be stored as an attribute of the view so that 
the methods can use them.

Trigger some event when the form submit button is disabled/enabled
-------------------------------------------------------------------

needed so that other system can update its jqueryui button
