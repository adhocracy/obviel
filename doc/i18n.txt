xgettext -L python -d obviel_forms forms2.js -o obviel_forms.pot

 msginit -l nl_NL -i obviel_forms.pot

then modify result so it says:

json_locale_data = {

}

and turn key into "obviel_forms".

and end the whole thing with ;

Note that the HTML page that includes the JS needs to be encoded as
UTF-8, to test this with flat HTML, use:

  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset="UTF-8" />

We need some kind of toolchain to do all this automatically. For some
reason the key is 'nl' in the generated JSON.

What do we do for updating messages? msgmerge nl.po ref.pot

Fanstatic could generate the JSON file automatically potentially,
using the compilation process.
