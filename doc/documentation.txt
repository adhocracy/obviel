Obviel Documentation
====================

Want to learn Obviel or just look something up? Obviel has extensive
documentation:

* :doc:`Obviel core manual <manual>`. Learn about how to create views and
  render them.

* :doc:`Obviel Templates <template>`. Some things are verbose in JavaScript and
  for that we want to use templates. Obviel's template language integrates
  with Obviel core.

* :doc:`i18n support <i18n>`. Obviel offers an extensive i18n system
  for client-side JavaScript applications.

* :doc:`i18n in Obviel Templates <template_i18n>`. How to mark up
  your templates so that they play nice with the i18n system.

* :doc:`Obviel Forms <form>`. Obviel's form library constructs forms for
  you and also does client-side validation. The form loads and submits
  data as JSON.

* :doc:`the Traject routing library <traject>`. Route to objects and construct
  paths for objects using this routing library. This lets you integrate
  browser bookmarking and history into your single-page web application.

* :doc:`Fanstatic integration <integration>`. If you use Fanstatic_ to 
  publish your JavaScript resources to the web, we have support.

* :doc:`API documentation <api>`.
